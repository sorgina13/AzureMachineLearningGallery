# Azure Machine Learning Gallery

Azure Machine Learning Gallery enables our growing community of developers and data scientists to share their machine learning pipelines, components, etc. to accelerate productivity in the machine learning lifecycle.

In this gallery, you can easily find a machine learning pipeline/component which is similar to the problem you are trying to solve, rather than starting from scratch.



## Component samples

| Scenario | Description |
| --- | --- |
|[Simple Algorithm for Recommendation (SAR)*](./pipelines/sar-pipeline) | An example of how to train, score and evaluate an SAR recommender using the Azure Machine Learning component. </br> This scenario contains the following components: </br> [Stratified Splitter](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/blob/master/reco_utils/azureml/azureml_designer_modules/module_specs/stratified_splitter.yaml): split dataset into training dataset and test dataset. </br> [SAR Training](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/blob/master/reco_utils/azureml/azureml_designer_modules/module_specs/sar_train.yaml): Train a simple algorithm recommender. </br> [SAR Scoring](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/blob/master/reco_utils/azureml/azureml_designer_modules/module_specs/sar_score.yaml): using test dataset to score the trained recommender. </br> [MAP](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/blob/master/reco_utils/azureml/azureml_designer_modules/module_specs/map.yaml): Mean Average Precision at K metric. </br> [nDCG](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/blob/master/reco_utils/azureml/azureml_designer_modules/module_specs/ndcg.yaml): Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG) at K metric. </br> [Precision at K](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/blob/master/reco_utils/azureml/azureml_designer_modules/module_specs/precision_at_k.yaml): Precision at K metric. </br> [Recall at K](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/blob/master/reco_utils/azureml/azureml_designer_modules/module_specs/recall_at_k.yaml): Recall at K metric. 
|[Spectral Residual Anomaly Detection](./pipelines/ad-pipeline)| Anomaly detection aims to discover unexpected events or rare items in data. It is designed to be accurate, efficient and general, using Spectral Residual (SR) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
| [Text classification using CNN](./pipelines/textcnn-pipeline) | An example of how to train, and score a CNN sentiment classifier using combination of Designer built-in modules and components. </br> This scenario contains the following components:</br> [TextCNN Train Model](./components/text-cnn/textcnn-train/train.yaml) </br> [TextCNN Score Model](./components/text-cnn/text-score/score.yaml) </br> [TextCNN Word to Id](./components/text-cnn/textcnn-preprocess/preprocess.yaml) </br>
| [Image classification using AML labeling dataset](./pipelines/labeling-image-classification-pipeline) | This scenario contains a component [Convert Labeling Data to Image Directory](./components/convert-labeling-data-to-image-directory/convert_labeling_data_to_image_directory.spec.yaml) to convert AML labeling dataset to ImageDirectory and other built-in modules in Designer, to build an image classification pipeline. |
| Natural Language Processing | There are following sample components in NLP scenario: </br> [Detect languages](./detect_languages/languages_component.yaml): Detect languages on text columns in a dataset. </br> [Semantic Textual Similarity](./semantic_textual_similarity/sts_component.yaml) </br> [Sequence Embedding](./sequence_embedding/sgt_train_component.yaml): Model sequence data by extracting short/long term sequence features and generate emebedding in finite-dimensional space. </br> [Score Sequence Embeddings](./sequence_embedding/sgt_score_component.yaml): Apply sequence embeddings to score data using transformation state from training dataset. 
| Forecasting | An example of building Prohpet Forecast as a custom module: </br> [Forecast](./forecast-Prophet/forecast/Forecast.yaml): Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well.|
